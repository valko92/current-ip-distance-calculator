# Valeriya Kozhynova | Current Senior Frontend Code Assessment

Hello! And thank you once again for considering me for the senior frontend position and for taking the time to interview me!

For this assessment, I decided to make a front-end single page app using ReactJS and a node.js RESTapi service to query and parse the two APIs.

Since this was a quick assignment, I did not bother with validation on the frontend side, however if custom validation were to happen on the client side, then the Form.js component will have to get split up and the inputs can then be validated and autocompleted as the user types. This single page app's build folder is deployed onto a sub-folder on my FTP server:

For the rest service, I wrote a small test for the rest service to test its output. It is build onto a free heroku dino:

https://connect-ip-distance.herokuapp.com/

Its endpoint is:

https://connect-ip-distance.herokuapp.com/distance

with the query parameters being origin (ip address) and destination (ip address).

Please let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing back from you!
